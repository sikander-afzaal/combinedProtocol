I'm a very active person and always looking to expand my skill set to perform to the best of my ability and will be taking the core duties of Community management and overall project development at Protocol X and will ensure that I put my all into being able to grow the project and community.

This has given me insight on spotting bad actors in the space and protecting others from making uninformed choices. I became a Senior Moderator in the first project I invested in (SFM) and this opened other doors in the DeFi community to help out in other protocols. I have branched off to be a discord administrator, with a focus on bots and keeping the community safe from scams, DM's, etc. I have been full time crypto for over a year and love it! The freedom that this has given me has been truly life changing. I feel like a better man, able to spend more time with my Daughter, and be less stressed. I have been able to connect with a lot of people in DeFi and build those networks to make the space a better and safer place to be. DeFi is about building and innovating so that we all can have a sustainable future. Let's raise a drink to Protocol X's continued success!`,

As you can see, I am a very active person, trying to develop new skills in any needed situation. Leaving nothing behind, learning new technologies, bringing new ideas.

While in the army I started a family and needed to make money when I got out so I ended up not going to school and got a job as a police officer. I am looking to get into solidity and be a full time developer in crypto. Crypto peaked my interest when I looked forward to the future of finance and noticed how versatile it can be for everybody around the world.`,
